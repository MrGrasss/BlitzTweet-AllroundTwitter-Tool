## Mass Posts Shiller

### Overview:
The Mass Posts Shiller feature automates the process of monitoring new posts from specified usernames, posting multiple comments on these new posts, and liking and retweeting these comments using idle accounts.

### Prerequisites:
1. **Proxies:** Ensure proxies are set up correctly in the supported formats.
2. **Tokens:** Use the correct format for your Twitter account tokens.
3. **Files:** Prepare the necessary files:
   - `post_shiller/usernames.txt`: One username per line. Each client will listen to one username.
   - `post_shiller/comments.txt`: One comment per line. Ensure you have more comments than clients to avoid reuse.
   - `post_shiller/idl_tokens.txt`: Store your idle tokens here.

### Setup:
1. **Username File:** Populate `post_shiller/usernames.txt` with the usernames whose posts you want to monitor.
2. **Comments File:** Populate `post_shiller/comments.txt` with the comments to be used.
3. **Idle Tokens:** Ensure your idle tokens are stored in `post_shiller/idl_tokens.txt`.
4. **Configure Proxies:** Set up proxies as needed.

### How to Use:
1. **Run the Mass Posts Shiller:** Launch the feature from the main menu.
2. **Monitor New Posts:** The tool will start monitoring new posts from the specified usernames.
3. **Shill Comments:** Once a new post is detected, the tool will post comments from `post_shiller/comments.txt`.
4. **Like and Retweet:** The tool will use idle accounts from `post_shiller/idl_tokens.txt` to like and retweet these comments to boost engagement.

### Example:
1. Add usernames to `post_shiller/usernames.txt`:
   ```
   user1
   user2
   user3
   ```

2. Add comments to `post_shiller/comments.txt`:
   ```
   Great post!
   Very informative.
   Thanks for sharing!
   ```

3. Add idle tokens to `post_shiller/idl_tokens.txt`:
   ```
   auth1:ct0
   auth2:ct0
   auth3:ct0
   ```

4. Ensure your proxies and tokens are configured properly.

5. Run the Mass Posts Shiller and let it handle the rest!
