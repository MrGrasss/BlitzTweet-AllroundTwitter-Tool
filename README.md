## Mass Tweet Replier

### Overview:

The Mass Tweet Replier feature automates the process of replying to multiple tweets based on specified keywords,
using a list of predefined replies.

### Prerequisites:

1. **Proxies:** Ensure proxies are set up correctly in the supported formats.
2. **Tokens:** Use the correct format for your Twitter account tokens.
3. **Files:** Prepare the necessary files:
    - `mass_replies/keywords.txt`: Contains the keywords to search for tweets.
    - `mass_replies/message.txt`: Contains the reply messages. Ensure you have enough messages to cover all tweets.
    - `mass_replies/media`: Store any media files you want to include in the replies.
    - `mass_replies/tagged_users.txt`: Include usernames to be tagged in your replies (one per line).

### Setup:

1. **Keywords File:** Populate `mass_replies/keywords.txt` with the keywords you want to search for in tweets.
2. **Replies File:** Populate `mass_replies/message.txt` with the reply messages.
3. **Media Directory:** Place any media files you want to use in `mass_replies/media`.
4. **Tagged Users File:** Populate `mass_replies/tagged_users.txt` with the usernames to be tagged in replies.
5. **Replied Tweets File** Replied tweets are saved in `mass_replies/replied_tweets.txt` to keep track of tweets that
   have been responded to, avoiding duplicate replies.

### Limitations:

- A maximum of 4 media items in total (images, GIFs, and videos combined) can be used per tweet.
- Tagging users through media only works on non-verified and public users.
- 100 Tweets per hour per token, tokens that reach this will be automatically removed.

### How to Use:

1. **Run the Mass Tweet Replier:** Launch the feature from the main menu.
2. **Search and Reply:** The tool will search for tweets containing the keywords from `mass_replies/keywords.txt`,
   and reply with messages from `mass_replies/message.txt`.
3. **Include Media and Tags:** If configured, the tool will attach media files from `mass_replies/media` and tag users
   in media from `mass_replies/tagged_users.txt`.

### Example:

1. Add keywords to `mass_replies/keywords.txt`:
   ```
   #keyword1
   #keyword2
   ```

2. Add replies to `mass_replies/message.txt`:
   ```

   Thanks for the info!

   replies will be handled, skipping any already processed tweets.

## Equal Follower

**Description:**

The Equal Follower feature allows you to distribute a list of usernames across multiple Twitter accounts,
ensuring that each account follows a unique set of users without any overlap.

**How It Works:**

1. **Upload Usernames:**
    - Fill `equal_follower/usernames.txt` with the usernames you want to follow. (1 per line)

2. **Set Parameters:**
    - Specify the number of tokens (Twitter accounts) to use.
    - Define the number of usernames each token should follow.

3. **Distribute Follows:**
    - The Equal Follower will allocate usernames to each account sequentially, ensuring no duplicates.

**Usage Example:**

- You have a `usernames.txt` file of 500 usernames.
- You want to use 10 accounts, each following 50 users.
- Equal Follower will ensure each of the 10 accounts follows a unique set of 50 users.

**Caution**

- A fresh account can follow up to 50 people per day and a

warmed-up account up to 80.
